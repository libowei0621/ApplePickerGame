# ApplePickerGame
<p>
A very simple apple picker game. It is the first program during I'm learning Unity by myself. I don't use apple tree and apple as
the droper and drop object in the game. I use the characters from FGO, which is a mobile game. The reason is that the purpose to
create this game not only learning Unity, but also to make fun with my friend. He really like the characters called Kiyohime and Okita in
FGO, so I make him as the pickers, and let the tree to drop these two characters.
